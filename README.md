# StreamDye
A simple header only C++ lib that can colorize most object's output with ANSI color codes

# Requirements
To use this header you need a compiler which supports <concepts>.
`gcc` 10 and `clang` 10 should both support this.

# Using
`#include "colorize.hpp"` and use `printWithColor(Object, Color)` to get a string which can easily be output to `std::cout`
All colors are defined in the header.
